## AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) - Insurance Analytics Project

### Project Overview:
AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) is committed to leveraging data analytics to optimize its car insurance planning and marketing efforts in South Africa. The goal of this project is to analyze historical insurance claim data, develop predictive models, and derive actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies and identify low-risk targets for premium reduction.

### Project Structure:
1. **Data Analysis and Visualization (Task 1):**
   - Explore and visualize historical insurance claim data to identify trends, anomalies, and patterns.

2. **Hypothesis Testing (Task 2):**
   - Statistically test hypotheses related to risk differences across provinces, zip codes, genders, and other segments.

3. **Statistical Modeling (Task 3):**
   - Develop predictive models using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to forecast insurance premiums.
   - Evaluate model performance and analyze feature importance to guide underwriting and risk assessment.

4. **Statistical Analysis Report:**
   - Compile a comprehensive report summarizing findings from Tasks 1 to 3, including insights, conclusions, and recommendations.

### Project Files:
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data analysis and visualization.
- `hypothesis_testing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for hypothesis testing.
- `statistical_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for statistical modeling.
- `statistical_analysis_report.pdf`: PDF report summarizing findings from Tasks 1 to 3.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing an overview of the project structure and files.

### Instructions for Running the Code:
1. Ensure Python and required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, scikit-learn) are installed.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open and run each Jupyter Notebook file (`data_analysis.ipynb`, `hypothesis_testing.ipynb`, `statistical_modeling.ipynb`) sequentially to execute the code and generate results.
4. Review the `statistical_analysis_report.pdf` for a detailed summary of findings and recommendations.
